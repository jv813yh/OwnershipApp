# Ownership - NYC Residences App

This application showcases available residences in New York City that users can buy, rent, or explore for potential options. Designed with a strong emphasis on a modern, user-friendly UI, this app offers a visually appealing experience while browsing properties.
Application uses .net MAUI for cross-platform, but it is created mainly for mobile development and use. I plan to gradually add more UI components and functions to the application to meet the modern design.
